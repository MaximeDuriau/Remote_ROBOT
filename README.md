# Remote_ROBOT
Here is the software for a remote-robot that I made for my final year project as a bachelor of engineering. 
The idea behind the project was to be able to control a robot remotely on the PC and make it carry out tasks such as picking up a ball. Make it press buttons in a precise order and assemble cubes.
To do this we used an esp32-cam that connects to the local server on the PC and we used an Arduino to control the robot.
